      <p>Estimated Annual Revenue
        Increase our revenue by selling bakery items, whole beans, grinders and coffee mugs.
        According to the 2011 Coffee Statistics Report, coffee shops are gaining speed rapidly in the 
        restaurant industry with a seven percent growth rate. Overall, coffee shops average sales 
        of 230 cups every day. Overall, juice average sales of 30 cups every day. That equals an 
        estimated 
        annual revenue of 32,000 juice and $289,000 for coffee or more each year, 
        depending upon the cost per cup and your actual location and sales.</p>

      <h3>Buisness Plan</h3>
      
      <ol>
<li> Find a location with a high number of passersby. Choices include shopping malls and strip malls near colleges or business 
        centers. Look for features like room in front of the store to place sidewalk tables, enough floor space for tables and 
        chairs, cozy armchairs, sofas and good traffic flow to order, pick up coffee and leave the store.</li>
<li> Obtain licenses and permits to comply with restaurant regulations. Contact the county's board of health to find out how to 
        obtain a food handling permit. The typical U.S. process to obtain a food handling permit includes passing an inspection, 
        filling out an application and submitting a fee. Collect state sales tax on items you sell, so obtain a general sales 
        license that allows you to collect these fees if needed.</li>
<li> Choose a name and create a logo for the coffee shop something interesting that people will remember. Once you have a name, 
      contact a graphic designer in your area. The graphic designer pairs your store name with a graphic, such as a steaming 
      cup of coffee. Use the logo on business cards, take-out cups and the sign that goes over the front door.</li>
     
    <li>   Purchase equipment and supplies, including coffee brewers, bean grinders, counters, tables, chairs, sofas and 
        armchairs. Locate a coffee blend supplier who will sell to you in bulk. You will need several different coffee and tea 
        blends. Also, purchase cups, saucers and metal spoons for in-store coffee drinkers and carry-out coffee cups, lids and 
        plastic stirrers for carry-out orders. 
        Remember items like sweeteners, individual cream cups and napkins.</li>
<li> Get insurance. Nationwide Insurance suggests inquiring about the following types of insurance: business property, 
        business liability, business auto, if you make deliveries, business crime and business umbrella. Property insurance 
        and liability are both musts.</li>
<li> Hire employees. Keep in mind how many hours a day the shop is open, busy times that require extra workers and whether 
  you want to hire full or part time workers. Advertise the positions in the paper and online job directories, collect 
  applications, interview and choose the best candidates.</li>
<li> Plan a grand opening. Send fliers or coupons to local businesses and invite the management to a free tasting. 
  Pass out free samples on the sidewalk in front of your establishment. Send press releases to the news media about the 
  grand opening. Have music, free samples of coffee and coupons for future purchases. If people like your coffee, repeat 
  business and word-of-mouth advertising is almost assured.</li>
